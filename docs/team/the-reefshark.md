## Project: KanBug Tracker

### Overview

This portfolio page highlights my contributions to KanBug Tracker - a Software Engineering project developed as part of the module CS2103T during my second year of undergraduate studies in the National University of Singapore.

### About the Team

We are five Year 2 Computer Science undergraduates reading CS2103T: Software Engineering. 

### About the project

KanBug Tracker is a lightweight, easy to use bug management tool that aims to empower developers to keep better track of the bugs in their projects. It provides users not only with a convenient way to record their bugs, but also allows them to better coordinate their efforts between various bugs and track the state of each bug throughout its lifecycle. The team has also developed various other user-centric features to provide our users with the functionality they need to empower their bug tracking efforts.

## Summary of contributions

* **New Feature**: I implemented the ability to add notes to a new or pre-existing bug via the `add` and `edit` commands respectively.

    * What it does: The feature provides the user the ability to add additional information to the bug they are tracking.
    * Justification: This feature improves the KanBug Tracker significantly because users can now include together with each bug additional information which could be regarding how they chanced upon the bug, how they plan to correct it or things that they have already tried to try and correct it. These information will be incredibly useful to the user especially in situations where they have not worked on their code in a long period of time or if they took a break to work on other projects. This gives the user the peace of mind that any information they want to keep track of will be available for them again later.

* **Code contributed**: You can view my functional code and test code contributions to KanBug Tracker [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=the-reefshark)

* **Other contributions:**

    * **Project management**:
        * As in-charge of Documentation, I monitored and coordinated the efforts between the team members to completely the weekly deliverables required of them for the UserGuide and DeveloperGuide to make sure the team was on track.
        * Contributed to the project ideation, product name, brainstorming user stories as well as key features.
        * Ensured that the workload regarding the documentation was split evenly between the group members.
    * **Documentation**:
        * Wrote sections on `help`, `list` and `edit` commands in KanBug Tracker's User Guide
        * Created Ui screenshots used under the "What can users expect?" section of the User Guide
        * Added warning and information boxes in multiple sections of the User Guide
        * Wrote section on Note feature in the Developer Guide.
